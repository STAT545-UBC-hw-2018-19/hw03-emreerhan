# HW03: Exploring `gapminder` using `ggplot2` and `dplyr`

In this assignment I further explored the gapminder dataset. I completed two miscellaneous tasks to become familiar with `ggplot2`, and then I explored the change in GDP/capita of Cuba as trade embargos were enacted by the USA.

These are the relevant files for my homework:
* [The Github document](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw03-emreerhan/blob/master/hw03-dplyr-gapminder.md)
* [The R markdown document](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw03-emreerhan/blob/master/hw03-dplyr-gapminder.Rmd)

I recommend you view the Github document if you would like to see all the graphs I produced.
